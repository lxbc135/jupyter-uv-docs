Let's select the default Python interpreter for this project in VSCode:
In the lower-right corner, click `.venv/...` and select the Python version from the virtual environment that we created earlier, for example, `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` for **Command Palette** and select **Python: Select Interpreter**, and select the Python version as mentioned above.

To run the python file, press the Arrow button (in the upper right corner).
You can press ``Ctrl+` `` (Ctrl+Backtick) to toggle the Terminal.
