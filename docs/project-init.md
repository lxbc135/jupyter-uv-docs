## Initialize project with uv

Create an empty folder:

```sh
mkdir my-project
```

Go to project folder:

```sh
cd my-project
```

Initialize uv configuration in the project:

```sh
uv init
```

It will create pyproject.toml configuration file.  That will be the project configuration file, which includes dependent packages.
